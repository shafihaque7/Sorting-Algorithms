This is a program that demonstrates all the sorting algorithm. 

To compile all the algorithm, type "make". To run the
program type "./sorting -A". This should show the name of the sort being used, then the number of elements, the number
 of moves and the number of compares.

 To enable special
 -p to print that specified number of elements. By default it prints hundred elements.
 -r to set the seed to something specific. By default it is 8062022
 -n to set the number of elements you want to sort.
